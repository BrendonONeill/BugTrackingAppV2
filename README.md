# Bug Tracking App V2
This is an updated version of the bug tracking app where I have moved over to next js from express. As I want to update the backend and clean up the UI for the Bug Tracker.

## UI update
### New UI in Next.js
This UI will change as I clean up the app and it goes live.

### Old UI in EJS
