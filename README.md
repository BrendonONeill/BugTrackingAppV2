# Bug Tracking App V2
This is an updated version of the bug tracking app where I have moved over to next js from express. As I want to update the backend and clean up the UI for the Bug Tracker.

## UI update
### New UI in Next.js
This UI will change as I clean up the app and it goes live.

### Old UI in EJS

## Working on
- Working with middleware as it runs on the edge I can't contact my database with mongoose so creating a work around.
- Cleaning up UI bugs.
- Clean UI validation and error pop ups.
- Cookie pop up.
- Few UI changes i'm not satisfied with.
- Force reload a page after action. 

## Researching
- Comments on others bugs with a clean UI. 
- Best way to deal with soft deleted bugs.
