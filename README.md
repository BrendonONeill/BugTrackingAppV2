# Bug Tracking App V2
This is a demo bug-tracking app that a company can use to track bugs in development.
This is an updated version of the bug tracking app, which I have moved over to next js from express. I wanted to update the backend and clean up the UI for the Bug Tracker.

## UI update
### New UI in Next.js
This UI will change as I clean up the app and it goes live.

## Updated
- Flashcards added to notify users that things are working
- Updated some performance
- Updated how cookies are handled
- Recycling Bin has a permanently delete function

## Working on
- Cleaning up backend code
- Cleaning up some UI
- Re-writing the jwt tokens but I need to research a way to deploy checks that is not on the middleware as I need to do a db check.
- Re-writing the jwt is a lot more complex than I was hoping but still working on it (react server components causing a problem with cookies).

## Extra features to add
- Adding a project section to create new projects and find bugs to do with that project.
