# Bug Tracking App V2
This is an updated version of the bug tracking app where I have moved over to next js from express. As I want to update the backend and clean up the UI for the Bug Tracker.

## UI update
### New UI in Next.js
This UI will change as I clean up the app and it goes live.

## Working on
- Have a better way to display navbar and header so its not just popping in when switching between bugs and users.
- Clean up accessablilty
- Clean up error handling on all api routes.
- Clean cookie notice UI
- MainContext needs to move back to main layout too many reloads happening.
- Need to rethink data fetching. 

## Updated
- Favicon updated
- Cleaned up cusor on hover
- Sorted out the wrong nav showing for admins and users.
- Fixed a bug with login page.
- Prevented Email dup's.
- Delet user card feedback on UI.

## Researching
- Write omments on others bugs with a clean UI that doesn't look out of place. 
- Best way to deal with soft deleted bugs.

## Bugs
- Need to fix a bug with getting users information when in production.
