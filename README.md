# Bug Tracking App V2
This is a demo bug-tracking app that a company can use to track bugs in development.
This is an updated version of the bug tracking app, which I have moved over to next js from express. I wanted to update the backend and clean up the UI for the Bug Tracker.

## UI update
### New UI in Next.js
This UI will change as I clean up the app and it goes live.
